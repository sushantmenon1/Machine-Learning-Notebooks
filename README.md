# Project Title: Machine Learning Models and NLP Techniques

## Overview
In this project, I have developed various machine learning (ML) models during my undergraduate studies. I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, optimized performance, and achieved high accuracy rates. Additionally, I explored diverse datasets to enhance my understanding of different domains. Throughout the project, I utilized popular libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Furthermore, the integration of deep learning techniques significantly improved the precision of the models.

## Key Features
- Developed multiple ML models
- Utilized NLP techniques for text analysis
- Optimized model performance
- Achieved high accuracy rates
- Explored diverse datasets
